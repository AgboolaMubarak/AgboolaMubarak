- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AgboolaMubarak. With over three years of experience in the field, I am a freelance machine learning engineer who has successfully applied my expertise in several areas of artificial intelligence. I have experience with a variety of tasks, such as regression analysis, binary and multiclass classification, NLP, and CV. I have also participated in hackathons on platforms such as Kaggle, Zindi, MachineHack, Analytics Vidhya, and others, all of which involved data in some way. Since I value efficiency, I always ensure that I complete the job on time. In addition, I have worked on various projects linked to software engineering and research, giving me valuable knowledge in these fields. I hope to use my talents to address issues on a global and local scale.
